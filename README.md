# infoGAN-pytorch
Implementation of infoGAN using PyTorch

## Results
## Catagorical variable(K) and continue variable(c1)
Row represents categorical variable from K = 0 to K = 9 (top to buttom) to characterize digits 
Column represents continue variable(c1)(Width) varing from -1 to 1(left to right)
